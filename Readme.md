# Awesome Watch Landing Page

Here is a responsive landing page template for watches

## Description
The project here is a simple landing page template made using HTML, CSS and a bit of JS. The template is presented on a single page and includes section elements (the html section tags) and is completely responsive, so it adapts correctly to mobile, tablet and computer formats. Above is the source code of the project.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

To use this project you don't need any great prerequisites. All you need is a code editor (if you want to modify or read the code) and an internet connection. Indeed the project is linked to the online library AOS (Animation On Scroll), which as its name suggests allows you to create scroll animations. So if you really want to see the animation aspect of the template you will need an internet connection. The version of AOS used is @2.3.1 .
In addition you can run this project whether you are under linux or under windows.

### Installing

To install the project you just need to download the source code above and extract it locally

### Executing program

Once the project is unzipped, you will find the index.html file at the root. Click on it to run the project.

If you want to modify the code you can take into account the architecture of the project folders by putting the modules or other tools in the asset folder according to their categories:

*Images in the "pictures" folder;

*The scripts in the "js" folder;

*Style sheets in the "css" folder;

*The fonts in the "fonts>fontFamilies" folder;

*the modules or framework in the "framework" folder;
